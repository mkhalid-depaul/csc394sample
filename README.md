# Project Pitch
Traditional hotels can be expensive and lack a personal touch, leaving travelers with limited and impersonal options. Airbnb solves this by allowing travelers to find and book unique rooms or homes directly from homeowners, offering a more affordable and personalized experience. The platform benefits travelers by providing more choices at better prices, while homeowners can earn extra income by renting out their spaces, creating a win-win for both sides.

# Front End
We will use Angular to build a website that allows users to log in as either hosts or travelers. Hosts can upload and manage their listings, while travelers can search and filter listings by location and travel dates.

# Back End
We will use MySQL to store user logins and listing information, and deploy a Node.js server to handle data transfer between the front end and the database.

# Requirements
## Functional
Users must be able to create an account, sign in, and manage their profile (as a guest or host).

Users should be able to search for available properties by location, dates, price range

Hosts should be able to list properties, including adding descriptions, photos, prices, availability, and house rules

Users must be able to book properties, specify check-in and check-out dates, and complete payment securely.

## Non Functional
Performance: The Airbnb platform should load within 2 seconds for 95% of users, even during peak traffic periods (e.g., holiday seasons or major events).

Security: All sensitive user data, including payment information, must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption 

Usability: The platform's user interface should achieve a User Satisfaction Score (via surveys or feedback) of at least 85% for ease of use.

Scalability: The system should be able to handle up to 10 million active users concurrently, with minimal performance degradation, during high-demand periods.
